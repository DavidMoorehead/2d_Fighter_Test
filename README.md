# 2d_Fighter_Test
A 2d Fighter created with 1 week to test my abilities with Java and JavaFX. This was initially a 1 week assignment for school to create a simple game, but I wanted to prepare for an actual project I want to finish (web browser fighting game).

This has flaws. It doesn't have a start menu, it doesn't have a loading screen. It's slightly off center so you can move more to the right of the screen than the left.

However, it has a lot of great things that are shown off:
-Pixel manipulation ~ taking and editting pixels in real time to make layering and images look perfect
-Animation Logic ~ each animation for gameplay has logic attached to it like an actual fighting game. You can't just do any input at any time and get the same results.
Depending on the circumstances, you'll dash, do a attack combo, etc.
-Hurtbox Logic - Some attacks can only hit when the opponent is in the air, or a certain distance from the player. 
-etc.
